Round 1: OO design coding question. Ask you to design a banking system which can create accounts, deposit money and make transfers. The follow-up question was a top k question. Asked you to find the most n active accounts by monetary activity. Similar to LC 2043.
Round 2: system design. Design a credit card portal. You can find the question by google search. The interviewer asked me some questions such as how do you implement batch processing? Why do you choose MongoDB rather than Cassandra?
Round 3: technical case question. Asked about why companies want to test the software? What kind of testing do you think the company will use? Then ask you to calculate the testing cost and compare to the budget and give a recommendation based on your result. Finally, ask you to debug a code snippet.
Round 4: behavior interview. Ask 3 questions and they will ask follow-up questions and go into very detail.
