# 4-Hour Rapid Review Plan for Coding Patterns
## General Tips:
* Focus on understanding the core idea behind each pattern, not memorizing full code.
* Use the starter code I gave you as templates to read through and mentally trace.
* Do 1 or 2 quick practice problems per pattern (if time allows).
* Prioritize patterns that appear most often or you’re weakest at.

## Hour 1: Core Understanding + Two Pointers / Sliding Window / Fast & Slow Pointers
* 10 min: Read the pattern definitions and understand when to apply each.
* 15 min: Study Two Pointers pattern.
    * Walk through starter code.
    * Quick problem: "Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted"
* 15 min: Study Sliding Window pattern.
* Walk through starter code.
* Quick problem: "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"
* 20 min: Study Fast & Slow Pointers pattern.
    * Walk through starter code.
    * Quick problem: "Linked List Cycle"

## Hour 2: Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS), Backtracking
* 20 min: Understand DFS / Backtracking.
    * Visualize recursion stack.
    * Problem: "Number of Islands" or "Subsets"
* 20 min: Understand BFS.
    * Visualize queue and level-by-level processing.
    * Problem: "Binary Tree Level Order Traversal"
* 20 min: Quick overview of Graph Representation and practice BFS/DFS on a simple graph.

## Hour 3: Binary Search, Dynamic Programming, Greedy
* 20 min: Binary Search basics & variants.
    * Practice "Search in Rotated Sorted Array"
* 20 min: Dynamic Programming essentials (memoization vs tabulation).
    * Practice "Climbing Stairs"
* 20 min: Greedy algorithms understanding.
    * Practice "Jump Game"

## Hour 4: Union Find, Topological Sort, Heap, Trie, Bit Manipulation
* 15 min: Union Find / Disjoint Set
    * Understand concept + starter code.
    * Quick problem: "Redundant Connection"
* 15 min: Topological Sort basics
    * Visualize graph dependency order.
    * Quick problem: "Course Schedule"
* 10 min: Heap / Priority Queue usage
    * Practice heapq.nlargest or "Kth Largest Element"
* 10 min: Trie concept and starter code
* 10 min: Bit Manipulation fundamentals
    * XOR trick, bit masking basics.

# Bonus Tips to Maximize Efficiency
* Skip full coding on all problems. Instead, read problem statement and think about the pattern it uses.
* Write down key template or pseudocode for each pattern on one sheet.
* Use a timer for each section — keep it strict.
* After the 4 hours, do a 5-minute mental recap of all patterns you reviewed.
