3Sum
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] where nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0, and the indices i, j and k are all distinct.

The output should not contain any duplicate triplets. You may return the output and the triplets in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]

Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]

Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0]

Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n^2) time and O(1) space, where n is the size of the input array.

Hint 1
A brute force solution would be to check for every triplet in the array. This would be an O(n^3) solution. Can you think of a better way?

Hint 2
Can you think of an algorithm after sorting the input array? What can we observe by rearranging the given equation in the problem?

Hint 3
We can iterate through nums with index i and get nums[i] = -(nums[j] + nums[k]) after rearranging the equation, making -nums[i] = nums[j] + nums[k]. For each index i, we should efficiently calculate the j and k pairs without duplicates. Which algorithm is suitable to find j and k pairs?

Hint 4
To efficiently find the j and k pairs, we run the two pointer approach on the elements to the right of index i as the array is sorted. When we run two pointer algorithm, consider j and k as pointers (j is at left, k is at right) and target = -nums[i], if the current sum num[j] + nums[k] < target then we need to increase the value of current sum by incrementing j pointer. Else if the current sum num[j] + nums[k] > target then we should decrease the value of current sum by decrementing k pointer. How do you deal with duplicates?

Hint 5
When the current sum nums[j] + nums[k] == target add this pair to the result. We can move j or k pointer until j < k and the pairs are repeated. This ensures that no duplicate pairs are added to the result.
