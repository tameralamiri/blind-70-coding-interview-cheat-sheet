Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "zxyzxyz"

Output: 3
Explanation: The string "xyz" is the longest without duplicate characters.

Example 2:

Input: s = "xxxx"

Output: 1
Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
s may consist of printable ASCII characters.

Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(m) space, where n is the length of the string and m is the number of unique characters in the string.

Hint 1
A brute force solution would be to try the substring starting at index i and try to find the maximum length we can form without duplicates by starting at that index. we can use a hash set to detect duplicates in O(1) time. Can you think of a better way?

Hint 2
We can use the sliding window algorithm. Since we only care about substrings without duplicate characters, the sliding window can help us maintain valid substring with its dynamic nature.

Hint 3
We can iterate through the given string with index r as the right boundary and l as the left boundary of the window. We use a hash set to check if the character is present in the window or not. When we encounter a character at index r that is already present in the window, we shrink the window by incrementing the l pointer until the window no longer contains any duplicates. Also, we remove characters from the hash set that are excluded from the window as the l pointer moves. At each iteration, we update the result with the length of the current window, r - l + 1, if this length is greater than the current result.
