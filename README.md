With the help of AI, I compiled my notes for the coding interviews based on the concepts mentioned in [blind 75 curated problems list](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=blind75)

This repo includes:
* [4 Hours Study Plan](4hours_study_plan.md)
* [Coding Patterns Cheat Sheet](coding_patterns_cheat_sheet.md)
* [Python Data Structures](python_data_structures.md)
* [Python Built-in Operations](python_builtin_operations.md)
